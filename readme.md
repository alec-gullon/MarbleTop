## About MarbleTop

MarbleTop is a sample PHP web application built using Laravel/Vue. It enables its users to share and
manage recipes and generate shopping plans that allow them to get in and out of the supermarket picking up
exactly what they need in the process and nothing more.

This is a Laravel project, so the process to view it in action is pretty simple:

- run `composer install` and `npm install` at the application route to install the project dependencies;
- create an empty file at `./database/database.sqlite` and run `php artisan migrate` to run the database migrations;
- run `php artisan demo:populate` to populate the database with seed data;
- you can now log in with the credentials `Guest` and `password` (these are automatically populated for you
in the login form).

MarbleTop is not a "real" project, in the sense that is not currently feature-complete enough to function as an
actual site. Nevertheless, I believe there is enough content here for it to be considered a strong demonstration
of my confidence and comfort with the underlying technologies.

I continue to add to it where I have the time/energy, but for now, I am happy with what is here to look at.
