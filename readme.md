## About MarbleTop

MarbleTop is a sample PHP web application built using Laravel/Vue. It enables its users to share and
manage recipes and generate shopping plans that allow them to get in and out of the supermarket picking up
exactly what they need in the process and nothing more.

You can experiment with the functionality on offer by visiting my <a href="http://marbletop.alecgullon.co.uk">hosted version</a>.

MarbleTop is not a "real" project, in the sense that is not currently feature-complete enough to function as an
actual site. Nevertheless, I believe there is enough content here for it to be considered a strong demonstration
of my confidence and comfort with the underlying technologies.

I continue to add to it where I have the time/energy, but for now, I am happy with what is here to look at.
