            <p>You're looking at a demonstration of <span class="highlighted">MarbleTop</span> and the functionality it has to offer. Some
                features have been disabled on this subdomain: in particular, account creation is currently not
                available.</p>

            <p>This doesn't mean that you can't have a look around at what there is on offer! Just sign in with
                the username <span class="highlighted">Guest</span> and password <span class="highlighted">password</span> and you can enjoy a full demonstration
                of what goes on behind the scenes. The data is reset every hour, so don't be afraid to have a good rummage around
                while you're in there.</p>
