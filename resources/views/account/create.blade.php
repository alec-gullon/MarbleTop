        <h1>Create an Account</h1>

        <p>You're looking at a demonstration of <span class="highlighted">MarbleTop</span> and the functionality it has to offer. Some
            features have been disabled on this subdomain: in particular, account creation is currently not
            available.</p>

        <p>This doesn't mean that you can't have a look around on what there is offer! Just sign in with
            the username <span class="highlighted">Guest</span> and password <span class="highlighted">password</span> and you can enjoy a full demonstration
            of what goes on behind the scenes. The data is reset every hour, so don't be afraid to have a good rummage around.</p>
